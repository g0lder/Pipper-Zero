### Pipper Installation
Step one: don't. Its not finished. 
Step two: Install waveshare stuff. I cloned the repo from JetsonNano and ran the install script for python.
Step three: Copy all the files and change paths to suit your needs.
Step four: Run the launcher?

### Make an app
Step one: Create the SH file in the scripts directory.
Step two: Add a logo with the same name but .bmp in the logos directory.
Step three: Congrats, you're done. Wow.

### TODO:
Make a better launcher that doesn't need full refreshes.
Make an install script to void all that crap.
