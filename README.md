# Pipper Zero: What is it?
The Pipper Zero is a cross between the Pi Zero and the Flipper Zero. It has a basic launcher and I plan to add scripts for things such as BadUSB, IR blasting, and such. The Pi Zero 02W actually has a better processor than the Flipper and WiFi so with added hardware it should be better.

## Hardware:
I am using a Raspberry Pi 02W, Waveshare V4, and Pisugar 3. More scripts may require an IR transceiver, RTL-SDR dongle, GPS, or more. If you are okay with python it should be easy to port to something else.

## Pipper Installation
1. **Don't.** *Its not finished.*  
2. Install waveshare stuff. I cloned the repo [from Waveshare](https://github.com/waveshareteam/e-Paper) and ran the install script for python.  
3. Copy all the files and change paths to suit your needs.  
4. Run the launcher?  

## Make an app
1. Create the SH file in the scripts directory.
2. Add a logo with the same name but .bmp in the logos directory.
3. Congrats, you're done. Wow.

### TODO:
Make a better launcher that doesn't need full refreshes.  
Make an install script to void all that crap.  
Web UI.  
BadUSB.  
SDR sniffer.
